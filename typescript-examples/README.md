See the same functionality implemented in both languages:
- Runtime error prevention
- Type safety benefits
- Developer experience improvements

## 📝 Practice Exercises

**📁 `exercises/`**

Hands-on exercises to test your understanding:
- Week 1: Basic types and functions
- Week 2: Interfaces and type aliases
- Week 3: Generics and advanced patterns
- Bonus: Type guards, mapped types, conditional types

## 🔧 Available Scripts

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Watch mode compilation
npm run build        # Build all TypeScript files
npm run clean        # Clean compiled files

# Learning
npm run examples     # Run example scripts
npm run verify       # Verify setup and environment

# Running Examples
npm start            # Run compiled examples
```

## 📖 How to Use This Learning Environment

### 1. **Follow the Week Structure**

Start with Week 1 and progress sequentially:

```bash
# Week 1
cd week1-foundations/basic-types
# Read and run basic-types.ts

cd ../functions
# Read and run functions.ts

cd ../arrays-objects
# Read and run arrays-objects.ts
```

### 2. **Compare JavaScript vs TypeScript**

```bash
cd javascript-vs-typescript
# Study comparison.ts to see the differences
```

### 3. **Practice with Exercises**

```bash
cd exercises
# Uncomment TODO sections and implement solutions
```

### 4. **Verify Your Progress**

```bash
npm run verify
# Check that everything is working correctly
```

## 🎯 Learning Tips

### ✅ Do This:

- **Type everything manually** - Don't copy-paste, type out examples
- **Experiment freely** - Modify examples and see what happens
- **Use TypeScript errors** - They're helpful learning tools
- **Build frequently** - Run `npm run build` to catch errors early
- **Progress gradually** - Don't skip ahead too quickly

### ❌ Avoid This:

- **Using `any` everywhere** - It defeats TypeScript's purpose
- **Ignoring error messages** - They're there to help you
- **Skipping the basics** - Foundations are crucial
- **Just reading** - You must practice coding to learn

## 🛠️ Development Environment

This setup includes:

- **TypeScript 5.0+** - Latest TypeScript features
- **Strict Mode** - Catches more potential issues
- **Source Maps** - Debug your TypeScript directly
- **Watch Mode** - Automatic recompilation on changes
- **Node.js Types** - Full Node.js type definitions

## 🎉 What's Next?

After completing this TypeScript learning track:

1. **Move to React with TypeScript** - `03-React-TypeScript/`
2. **Build backend APIs** - `04-Express/`
3. **Learn database integration** - `05-MongoDB/`
4. **Create full-stack applications**

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**TypeScript not found:**
```bash
npm install  # Make sure dependencies are installed
```

**Compilation errors:**
```bash
npm run verify  # Check setup
npx tsc --noEmit  # Check for type errors without compilation
```

**Watch mode not working:**
```bash
npm run clean   # Clean old files
npm run dev     # Restart watch mode
```

## 🛡️ Remember

> TypeScript is JavaScript with superpowers. Every type you add makes your code more reliable, more maintainable, and more professional.

**Happy Learning!** 🚀
