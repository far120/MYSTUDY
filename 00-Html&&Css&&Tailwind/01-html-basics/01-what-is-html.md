# 📄 What is HTML? - Your Introduction to Web Development

**Congratulations!** You're about to write your first line of code. Before we jump in, let's understand exactly what HTML is and why it's so important.

## 🤔 What is HTML?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**. Let's break this down:

- **HyperText** = Text that can link to other text (like clicking a link to go to another page)
- **Markup** = A way of adding instructions to text (like telling text to be bold or big)
- **Language** = A set of rules that computers understand

**In simple terms:** HTML is the language we use to create web pages and tell browsers how to display content.

## 🌐 How Do Websites Work?

When you type a website address (like google.com) into your browser, here's what happens:

1. **Your browser** asks the internet "Can I have the Google website please?"
2. **Google's server** sends back HTML code
3. **Your browser** reads the HTML code and displays it as the beautiful Google homepage you see

**The amazing part:** Every website you've ever visited is built with HTML!

## 🏗️ HTML is Like Building Blocks

Think of HTML like LEGO blocks:

- Each HTML element is like a LEGO piece
- You combine different pieces to build something bigger
- Just like LEGO, you follow certain rules about how pieces fit together

## 👀 What Does HTML Look Like?

Don't worry - you don't need to understand this yet, but here's what HTML code looks like:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<p>This is my first web page!</p>
<img src="my-photo.jpg" alt="A photo of me" />
<a href="https://google.com">Click here to visit Google</a>
```

And here's what a browser would show:

---

# Welcome to My Website

This is my first web page!
![A photo of me]
[Click here to visit Google](https://google.com)

---

## 🔤 HTML Uses "Tags"

HTML uses things called **tags** to mark up content. Tags are like instructions written in angle brackets `< >`.

**Example:**

- `<h1>` means "make this text a big heading"
- `<p>` means "this is a paragraph of text"
- `<img>` means "show an image here"

**Don't worry about memorizing these yet** - we'll learn them step by step!

## 🎯 Why Learn HTML First?

HTML is the foundation of web development because:

1. **Every website uses it** - No exceptions!
2. **It's beginner-friendly** - You can see results immediately
3. **It's logical** - Once you understand the pattern, it makes sense
4. **It's powerful** - You can build real websites with just HTML
5. **It opens doors** - HTML is your gateway to becoming a web developer

## 🌟 What Will You Build?

Starting today, you'll build:

- **Your first web page** (in the next lesson!)
- **An "About Me" page** with your photo and information
- **A contact form** where people can send you messages
- **A simple website** with multiple pages

By the end of this week, you'll have created something real that you can show to friends and family!

## 🤯 Cool HTML Facts

- **HTML was invented in 1991** by Tim Berners-Lee (he also invented the World Wide Web!)
- **The first website ever created** is still online: http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html
- **HTML is not a programming language** - it's a markup language (but that doesn't make it less important!)
- **You can view the HTML of any website** by right-clicking and selecting "View Page Source"

## ✨ Try This Right Now!

**Let's see HTML in action:**

1. Go to any website (like google.com)
2. Right-click anywhere on the page
3. Select "View Page Source" or "Inspect"
4. You're now looking at the HTML code that creates that website!

_Don't worry if it looks complicated - you'll understand it soon!_

## 🎯 What's Next?

In the next lesson, you'll:

- Set up your coding environment
- Create your very first HTML file
- Open it in a browser and see your creation come to life!

This is going to be exciting! You're about to write your first code and see it work in a real web browser.

## 💭 Remember

- **It's okay to feel overwhelmed** - Every developer started here
- **You don't need to memorize everything** - We'll practice repeatedly
- **Mistakes are part of learning** - Every error teaches you something
- **Take breaks** - Your brain needs time to process new information
