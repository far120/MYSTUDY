# 🚀 Your First Web Page - The Magic Moment!

**This is it!** You're about to create your very first web page and see it come to life in a browser. This is the moment where coding stops being theoretical and becomes real.

## 🛠️ Setting Up Your Workspace

Before we write our first code, let's get organized.

### Step 1: Create Your Project Folder

1. **Open File Explorer** (Windows) or **Finder** (Mac)
2. **Navigate to a location** you'll remember (like your Desktop or Documents folder)
3. **Create a new folder** called `my-first-website`
4. **Open this folder** - this is your workspace!

### Step 2: Open VS Code

1. **Open VS Code** (if you don't have it, download it from code.visualstudio.com)
2. **Click "File" → "Open Folder"**
3. **Select your `my-first-website` folder**
4. **Click "Select Folder"**

**Congratulations!** You now have a professional development environment set up!

## 💻 Creating Your First HTML File

### Step 3: Create Your First File

1. **In VS Code**, right-click in the Explorer panel (left side)
2. **Select "New File"**
3. **Name it `index.html`** (the `.html` extension is important!)
4. **Press Enter**

**Why `index.html`?** This is the standard name for the main page of a website. Web servers automatically look for this file first!

### Step 4: Write Your First HTML Code

**Type the following code exactly as shown** (don't copy-paste - typing helps you learn!):

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
    <p>This is my very first web page!</p>
    <p>I'm learning HTML and I'm excited to become a web developer!</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

**Don't worry about understanding every part yet** - we'll explain it all in the next lesson!

### Step 5: Save Your File

1. **Press `Ctrl + S`** (Windows) or `Cmd + S`\*\* (Mac)
2. **Or click "File" → "Save"**

**Important:** Always save your files before testing them!

## 🌐 Opening Your Web Page in a Browser

**This is the magical moment!** Let's see your code come to life:

### Step 6: Open in Browser

**Method 1 (Easy way):**

1. **In VS Code**, right-click on your `index.html` file
2. **Select "Open with Live Server"** (if you have the Live Server extension)
3. **Your browser will open automatically!**

**Method 2 (Manual way):**

1. **Open your file explorer**
2. **Navigate to your `my-first-website` folder**
3. **Double-click on `index.html`**
4. **Your browser will open with your web page!**

## 🎉 What You Should See

Your browser should display:

---

# Hello, World!

This is my very first web page!

## I'm learning HTML and I'm excited to become a web developer!

**If you see this, CONGRATULATIONS!** 🎉 You've just created your first web page!

## 🔍 Understanding What Just Happened

You just:

1. **Wrote HTML code** in a text editor
2. **Saved it as an .html file**
3. **Opened it in a browser**
4. **Saw the browser interpret your code** and display it as a web page

**This is exactly how all websites work!** The only difference between your page and Google's homepage is complexity - the fundamental process is identical.

## 🧪 Let's Experiment!

**Try changing some things and see what happens:**

### Experiment 1: Change the Title

1. **Change** `<title>My First Web Page</title>` to `<title>John's Amazing Website</title>` (use your name!)
2. **Save the file** (`Ctrl/Cmd + S`)
3. **Refresh your browser** (`F5` or `Ctrl/Cmd + R`)
4. **Look at the browser tab** - the title should change!

### Experiment 2: Add More Content

1. **Add this line** before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<p>Today's date is: [insert today's date]</p>
```

2. **Save and refresh**
3. **See your new content appear!**

### Experiment 3: Make Text Bold

1. **Change one of your paragraphs** to:

```html
<p>This is my <strong>very first</strong> web page!</p>
```

2. **Save and refresh**
3. **See how `<strong>` makes text bold!**

## 🎯 Understanding Your Code (Simple Version)

Let's quickly understand what you wrote:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>        ← Tells browser "this is HTML"
<html>                 ← Starts the web page
<head>                 ← Information about the page
    <title>            ← What shows in browser tab
<body>                 ← The actual content people see
    <h1>               ← Big heading
    <p>                ← Paragraph of text
</html>                ← Ends the web page
```

**Don't worry about memorizing this yet** - we'll dive deeper in the next lesson!
