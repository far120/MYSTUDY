## üí™ Exercise 1: Custom Brand System

**Challenge:** Create a complete brand color system with semantic naming.

### **Requirements:**

- [ ] Define primary, secondary, and accent color palettes

- [ ] Use CSS custom properties for theme switching
- [ ] Build components using your color system

### **Starter Code:**

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Brand System Exercise</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <script>
      tailwind.config = {
        darkMode: "class",
        theme: {
          extend: {
            colors: {
              // TODO: Add your custom brand colors here
            },
          },
        },
      };
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <!-- TODO: Build a brand showcase page -->
  </body>
</html>
```

### **Success Criteria:**

- Colors work in both light and dark modes
- Semantic colors are clearly distinguishable
- Brand personality is evident through color choices
- All colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements

## üé≠ Exercise 2: Advanced Animation System

**Challenge:** Create a component library with sophisticated animations.

### **Requirements:**

- [ ] Build custom keyframe animations
- [ ] Implement staggered animations for lists
- [ ] Create loading states with multiple animation types
- [ ] Add hover effects with multiple properties
- [ ] Ensure animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`

### **Components to Build:**

1. **Animated Card Grid** - Cards that animate in sequence
2. **Loading Button** - Multiple loading states
3. **Interactive Navigation** - Smooth hover effects
4. **Modal System** - Fade and slide animations
5. **Progress Indicators** - Animated progress bars

### **Success Criteria:**

- Animations feel natural and purposeful
- Performance remains smooth on slower devices
- Accessibility preferences are respected
- Animations enhance rather than distract from content

## üåô Exercise 3: Production Dark Mode

**Challenge:** Build a complete dark mode system with persistence and smooth transitions.

### **Requirements:**

- [ ] Theme toggle with system preference detection
- [ ] Smooth transitions between themes
- [ ] Persistent theme storage
- [ ] Different images for light/dark themes
- [ ] Accessible color combinations in both modes

### **Features to Implement:**

- Toggle button with animated icons
- Theme preference menu (light/dark/system)
- Image switching based on theme
- Form elements that work in both modes
- Navigation that adapts to themes

### **Bonus Challenges:**

- Add a third theme (high contrast)
- Implement theme-based chart colors
- Create theme-aware syntax highlighting

## ‚ö° Exercise 4: Performance Optimization Lab

**Challenge:** Optimize a bloated website for maximum performance.

### **Starting Point:**

A slow website with:

- Large CSS bundle with unused utilities
- Unoptimized images
- Blocking font loading
- No critical CSS extraction
- Poor Core Web Vitals scores

### **Optimization Tasks:**

- [ ] Implement critical CSS extraction
- [ ] Optimize and lazy load images
- [ ] Set up font loading strategy
- [ ] Configure CSS purging
- [ ] Add performance monitoring
- [ ] Achieve Lighthouse score >90

### **Deliverables:**

- Before/after performance comparison
- Lighthouse audit improvements
- Bundle size reduction report
- Web Vitals measurement implementation

## üé® Exercise 5: Component Design System

**Challenge:** Build a complete, production-ready component library.

### **Components to Create:**

1. **Button System** - Multiple variants, sizes, states
2. **Form Controls** - Inputs, selects, checkboxes, radio buttons
3. **Navigation** - Header, sidebar, breadcrumbs, pagination
4. **Data Display** - Tables, cards, lists, badges
5. **Feedback** - Alerts, toasts, modals, tooltips
6. **Layout** - Grid systems, containers, dividers

### **Requirements:**

- [ ] Consistent design tokens
- [ ] Accessible markup and interactions
- [ ] Responsive design patterns
- [ ] Dark mode support
- [ ] TypeScript/PropTypes for props
- [ ] Storybook documentation
- [ ] Unit tests for each component
