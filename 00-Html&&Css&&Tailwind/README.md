# 🎨 HTML, CSS & Tailwind CSS - Zero to Hero Journey

**Welcome to your web development adventure!** This is where your programming journey begins. If you've never written a single line of code before, don't worry - we'll start from the very beginning and build your skills step by step.

## 🤔 What Will You Learn?

By the end of this phase, you'll be able to:

- ✅ **Create web pages** from scratch using HTML
- ✅ **Make them beautiful** with CSS styling
- ✅ **Build responsive designs** that work on phones, tablets, and computers
- ✅ **Use Tailwind CSS** to create professional-looking websites quickly
- ✅ **Understand how websites work** and how they're built

## 🎯 Why Start Here?

Think of building a website like building a house:

- **HTML** = The structure (walls, rooms, doors)
- **CSS** = The decoration (paint, furniture, style)

Every website you've ever visited uses these technologies!
