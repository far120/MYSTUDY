# 9. What are Loops? - Repeating Tasks Efficiently 🔄

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand:

- What loops are and why they're essential in programming
- When and why you need to repeat tasks
- The different types of loops available
- How loops save time and reduce code duplication

## 🤔 What Are Loops?

Imagine you need to:

- Print "Hello" 100 times
- Check every student's grade in a class
- Count from 1 to 1000
- Process every item in a shopping cart

Without loops, you'd have to write the same code over and over again. Loops let you tell the computer: "Do this task repeatedly until I tell you to stop."

## 🚫 The Problem Without Loops

Let's say you want to print numbers 1 through 10:

### Without Loops (Tedious!)

```javascript
console.log(1);
console.log(2);
console.log(3);
console.log(4);
console.log(5);
console.log(6);
console.log(7);
console.log(8);
console.log(9);
console.log(10);
// Imagine doing this for 1000 numbers! 😰
```

### With Loops (Elegant!)

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
// Just 3 lines to do the same thing! ✨
```

## 🔄 Types of Loops in JavaScript

JavaScript has several types of loops, each designed for different scenarios:

### 1. **for** Loop

Best for when you know exactly how many times to repeat.

```javascript
// Count from 1 to 5
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
  console.log(`Count: ${i}`);
}
```

### 2. **while** Loop

Best for when you want to repeat until a condition becomes false.

```javascript
// Keep asking until user gives correct answer
let password = "";
while (password !== "secret") {
  password = "secret"; // Simulate user input
  console.log("Checking password...");
}
console.log("Access granted!");
```

### 3. **do...while** Loop

Like while, but always runs at least once.

```javascript
let userChoice;
do {
  userChoice = "yes"; // Simulate user input
  console.log("Do you want to continue?");
} while (userChoice === "yes");
```

### 4. **for...of** Loop (We'll learn this later)

Best for going through lists of items.

```javascript
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
for (let fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit);
}
```

## 🎯 Real-World Loop Examples

### Example 1: Multiplication Table

```javascript
let number = 7;
console.log(`Multiplication table for ${number}:`);

for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  let result = number * i;
  console.log(`${number} × ${i} = ${result}`);
}
```

### Example 2: Countdown Timer

```javascript
console.log("Rocket launch countdown:");

for (let count = 10; count >= 1; count--) {
  console.log(count);
}
console.log("🚀 Blast off!");
```

### Example 3: Grade Calculator

```javascript
// Calculate average of multiple grades
let totalGrades = 5;
let sum = 0;

console.log("Calculating average grade...");

for (let i = 1; i <= totalGrades; i++) {
  let grade = 85 + i; // Simulate different grades
  console.log(`Grade ${i}: ${grade}`);
  sum = sum + grade;
}

let average = sum / totalGrades;
console.log(`Average grade: ${average}`);
```

### Example 4: Password Strength Checker

```javascript
let password = "MyP@ssw0rd123";
let strengthPoints = 0;

console.log(`Checking password: ${password}`);

// Check each character in the password
for (let i = 0; i < password.length; i++) {
  let char = password[i];

  if (char >= "0" && char <= "9") {
    strengthPoints++;
    console.log(`Found number: ${char}`);
  }

  if (char >= "A" && char <= "Z") {
    strengthPoints++;
    console.log(`Found uppercase: ${char}`);
  }

  if (char === "@" || char === "!" || char === "#") {
    strengthPoints++;
    console.log(`Found special character: ${char}`);
  }
}

console.log(`Password strength points: ${strengthPoints}`);
```

## 🧠 Understanding Loop Components

Every loop has these key parts:

### 1. **Initialization**

Where the loop starts

```javascript
let i = 1; // Start counting at 1
```

### 2. **Condition**

When to keep going

```javascript
i <= 10; // Keep going while i is 10 or less
```

### 3. **Update**

How to change the loop variable

```javascript
i++; // Add 1 to i each time
```

### 4. **Body**

What to do each time

```javascript
console.log(i); // Print the current number
```

## 🎮 Loop Patterns You'll Use Often

### Pattern 1: Counting Up

```javascript
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
}
```

### Pattern 2: Counting Down

```javascript
for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
  console.log(i); // 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
}
```

### Pattern 3: Skip Counting

```javascript
for (let i = 2; i <= 20; i += 2) {
  console.log(i); // 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20
}
```

### Pattern 4: Processing Items

```javascript
let items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {
  console.log(`Item ${i + 1}: ${items[i]}`);
}
```

## 🏋️‍♂️ Practice Examples

### Example 1: Sum Calculator

```javascript
// Calculate sum of numbers 1 through 100
let sum = 0;

for (let i = 1; i <= 100; i++) {
  sum = sum + i;
}

console.log(`Sum of 1 to 100 is: ${sum}`); // 5050
```

### Example 2: Even Number Finder

```javascript
console.log("Even numbers between 1 and 20:");

for (let i = 1; i <= 20; i++) {
  if (i % 2 === 0) {
    // If remainder is 0, it's even
    console.log(i);
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Star Pattern

```javascript
// Create a triangle pattern
for (let row = 1; row <= 5; row++) {
  let stars = "";

  for (let star = 1; star <= row; star++) {
    stars = stars + "*";
  }

  console.log(stars);
}
// Output:
// *
// **
// ***
// ****
// *****
```

## ⚠️ Common Beginner Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Infinite Loops

```javascript
// ❌ This will run forever!
for (let i = 1; i >= 1; i++) {
  console.log(i); // i keeps getting bigger, never stops!
}

// ✅ Correct version
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i); // Stops at 10
}
```

### Mistake 2: Off-by-One Errors

```javascript
// ❌ This prints 1-9 (missing 10)
for (let i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}

// ✅ This prints 1-10 (correct)
for (let i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

### Mistake 3: Wrong Update Direction

```javascript
// ❌ Counting down but going up
for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i++) {
  // i++ makes it go up!
  console.log(i);
}

// ✅ Correct countdown
for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i--) {
  // i-- makes it go down
  console.log(i);
}
```

## 🧪 When to Use Each Type of Loop

### Use **for** loop when:

- You know exactly how many times to repeat
- You're counting or iterating through a sequence
- You need a counter variable

### Use **while** loop when:

- You don't know how many times to repeat
- You want to repeat until something happens
- The number of repetitions depends on user input or calculations

### Examples of When to Use Each:

#### **for** loop scenarios:

- Print multiplication table (exactly 10 times)
- Process each item in a list (known quantity)
- Draw a pattern with specific dimensions

#### **while** loop scenarios:

- Keep asking for password until correct
- Read user input until they type "quit"
- Generate random numbers until you get a specific one

## 📚 Key Takeaways

1. **Loops prevent code repetition** - Write once, repeat many times
2. **for loops are great for counting** - When you know how many times
3. **while loops are great for conditions** - When you don't know how many times
4. **Every loop needs a way to stop** - Avoid infinite loops!
5. **Loop variables help track progress** - Usually named `i`, `j`, `k`
6. **Loops are building blocks** - Essential for most programs

## 🎯 Real-World Applications

Loops are everywhere in programming:

- **Games**: Update every enemy, check every bullet
- **Websites**: Display every product, validate every form field
- **Apps**: Process every message, update every contact
- **Data**: Calculate totals, find patterns, generate reports
