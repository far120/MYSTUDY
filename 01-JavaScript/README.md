42. **Mini Games Collection** - Fun programming challenges

## 📖 How to Study Each Topic

### For Each Topic File:

1. **📚 Read the full explanation** (understand the concept)
2. **👀 Study all code examples** (see it in action)
3. **💻 Type out examples yourself** (don't copy-paste!)
4. **🏋️ Complete all exercises** (practice makes perfect)
5. **🤔 Ask yourself questions** (do I really understand this?)
6. **➡️ Only move to next topic when comfortable**

### Study Schedule Recommendation:

- **30-60 minutes daily** (consistency beats intensity)
- **2-3 topics per day maximum** (don't rush)
- **Review previous topics weekly** (reinforcement)
- **Take breaks** (your brain needs rest to absorb)

## 💡 Important Learning Tips

### ✅ Do This:

- Write code by hand (builds muscle memory)
- Experiment and break things (learn from errors)
- Explain concepts out loud (teaches understanding)
- Build small projects frequently (apply knowledge)

### ❌ Avoid This:

- Skipping the basics (everything builds on them)
- Memorizing without understanding (you'll forget)
- Comparing your progress to others (everyone learns differently)
- Getting frustrated with mistakes (they're part of learning)
